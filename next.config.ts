/**
 * Wires up Cloudflare bindings (ASSETS, the WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE service,
 * etc. -- see wrangler.jsonc) during plain `next dev`, so local dev behaves
 * the same way as the deployed Worker.
 *
 * Gated on Next's own `phase` argument (the only reliable dev-vs-production
 * signal) -- NOT on `@opennextjs/cloudflare`'s own internal dev-detection,
 * which turned out to also fire under `next start`. A real production VPS
 * deploy confirmed this the hard way: with `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev()`
 * called unconditionally at module scope (the previous version of this
 * file), `systemctl status` showed a stray `workerd` process running inside
 * the VPS's own systemd service, wasting memory/CPU for tooling that has no
 * business running outside local dev.
