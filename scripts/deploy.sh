# Xsign-Opensource deploy script — Server mode (see docs/DEPLOY.md).
#
# Run from inside the cloned repo on the server (e.g. /opt/xsign-opensource),
# as the app's dedicated user. Used both for the first deploy and every
# redeploy afterwards. Never touches .env (gitignored; `git reset --hard`
# below only affects tracked files) and never invents its own build/start
# steps — reuses exactly the scripts already declared in package.json.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/deploy.sh [branch]   (default: main)
